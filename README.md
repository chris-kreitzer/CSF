# CSF

## Finding clinical actionable CNA from CSF samples;
- there are a lot of overlaps within the DNA alignments in CSF samples;
- meaning that two reads are supporting one Base; double count (especially for short-DNA molecules);
- snp-pileup -x --> ignore thoes reads | when supplied -x (all reads are counted)   
- -A count anomalous read pairs: https://www.biostars.org/p/91183/

# finding a way to compare DMP/CSF samples;
ratio between overlaps and non-overlaps perhaps

Fake
